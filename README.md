This is a repository based on the teachings from my Data science programming classes. A mix of lectures and excercise-classes. 

Our teacher mentioned in mid November. They gonna slowly pivot out of the basics and get into the data analysis part. 

My teachings are also supported with some dataCamp courses, that has been provided for free by our school, SDU. 
  DataCamp are something. But not the best in the earlier stages. But as its getting more into it, the interesting and real learning starts to be apperent.

Along side, Im have also created a seperate repository "MyPythonJourney" thats test out python on my own at home.
Before hand Ive done the basics of Python. But until now I have also tested out some [1. Nympy, 2. Pandas, 3. Matplotlibs]

















  ###Opinions/ Reviews###
Groups: We didnt receive our groups to work with until 1.5month in. With was quit disapointing. So alot of disfunction the day we received them. 

The teacher: Most of my classmates aggreed that, our teacher is without a doubt knowledgable and really smart. But its like her head is everywhere. So she might start to talk about one thing and suddenly switch to another one. Where we're like "Stay on topic!".
Its overall really confusing classes to follow by. 

TA's: They help our to get through the excercise sheets they give us.
