# first excercise:

working_str = "Hello, World!"

steps_jump = 2 #meaning the loop should skip every second value
initial_index = 0 #starting with index 1
for i in range(initial_index, len(working_str),steps_jump): #The order
    print(working_str[i])
#This script only every second letter in wello world
